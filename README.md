# interactiveDailyPlanner
Add a script file that will display current day on tope of the calendar. The calendar should be from 9am to 5pm, it should also be color coded based on past, present, and future times. Clicking on a time block should alow us to enter an event and save it when clicking on saved button. It should all be saved in local storage, even after page is refreshed.
